<p><b>H</b>ey everyone, with the year drawing to a close we thought we’d reflect on where we’re at with the project and let you know our plans for 2020. Thanks to everyone that has liked, retweeted and interacted with us in some form the past year, it’s hugely appreciated.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that we’ve been a bit light on the updates recently. It’s amazing how quickly 4 months can zip by and I’d love to say we’ve been hard at work since then but… we haven’t! The reason for that is two-fold. You may have seen recently that Ruffian started working with Rockstar so it’s been a busy old time at the day job and it kind of put our plans for Revoider on hold.</p>
<p>Also… Paul had a kid (his third!) and I have a 1 year old to chase around so sometimes, in the best possible manner, life gets in the way.</p>
<p>So what’s next for Revoider? Our original plans were to continue development as a studio project and as a result of that, the intended design was probably a bit larger in scale than is manageable for a two man team. However, after some recent discussions I think we’ve got an idea of how we can scale it back into something the two of us can get off the ground in our spare time.</p>
<p>We’ve got some things to sort out on the business end first (software, perforce etc) but we’re aiming to be back in full swing come January. We’re going to start building out an introduction to the game in the new year and will be sharing our progress along the way.</p>
<p>We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished this year and excited for what <b>2020</b> holds.</p>
<br/><br/>
<p> Catch you all in the new year!</p>
